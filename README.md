# Adapting Testing Methodology (ATM)

The Adaptive Testing Methodology (ATM) project provides context-adjusted security testing methodologies based on factors such as time available to test, platform, technology stack, plugins, modules, and other variables. The goal is to provide the most concise, customized, and accurate testing methodology possible based on available factors.

## How it works

You submit a domain and a time limit, and ATM will return you a customized list of testing steps for that tech stack and time constraint.

### Labeling

The ATM project is organized at the top level by security testing type, e.g., Web, Mobile, IoT, ERP, Forensics, Mainframe, etc. Under each testing type there will be a series of checks that can be performed as part of a security assessment.

Each check will be labeled as part of a foksonomy, meaning that it can have multiple labels assigned to it. As an example, a check for a vulnerable WordPress component might be labeled as WordPress, Web, CMS, etc.
