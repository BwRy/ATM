# 802.11 Rules
80211 | Ensure that wireless traffic is configured for WPA2 Enterprise
80211 | Ensure that encryption is enabled for all wireless traffic.
Ensure that
# Bluetooth
BLUETOOTH | Use bluesniff to evaluate the BT pairing process for the device.
BLUETOOTH | Capture and analyze the bluetooth traffic on the device for encryption strength.
BLUETOOTH | Evaluate the bluetooth protocol and ensure it's at the latest version.
# USB
USB | Fuzz the USB interface for filewriting vulnerabilities upon connection.
USB | Trace the load process that occurs during mounting.
# Custom
CUSTOM | Capture the custom communications protocol using tcpdump and/or Wireshark.
CUSTOM | Determine which portions of the protocol handle connection details as opposed to data.
CUSTOM | Evaluate the data being sent back and forth, and determine if it's sensitive.
CUSTOM | Determine if the data is protected with industry-standard encryption, custom encryption, encoding, etc.
CUSTOM | Determine if the protocol can be fuzzed to produce a crash condition.
# APIs
APIS | Make a full map of all APIs used by the system, including those from mobile applications.
APIS | Test the backend web infrastructure for XSS. 
APIS | Test the backend web infrastructure for SQLi. 
APIS | Test the backend web infrastructure for R/LFI.
APIS | Test the backend web APIs for common API flaws.
APIS | Ensure that restrictions on data retrieval functions are server-side and not client-side.
# Over the Air Updates
OTA | Capture all traffic during a legitimate update.
OTA | Determine the location of the server-side software.
OTA | Determine whether authentication was required to perform the update.
OTA | Determine whether encryption was used to protect update authentication.
OTA | Determine whether encryption was used to protect the software download.
OTA | Determine whether digital signatures were used to validate the software as legitimate.
OTA | Determine whether the remote software location is writable.
# TCP/IP Rules
TCPIP | Capture full PCAP using tcpdump or Wireshark and run it through updated IDS.
TCPIP | Use tshark to identify all hosts communicated with during device operation.
TCPIP | Determine which of these devices are remote vs. local.
TCPIP | Determine if any third-party communication took place.
TCPIP | Determine whether any third-party communication contained sensitive data.
# Firmware testing
FIRM | Run strings on the firmware and explore occurrences of the following strings: username, password, birth, ssn, etc.
FIRM | Unpack the firmware and use firmwalker to find a wide range of vulnerabilities.
FIRM | Determine whether firmware can be modified and still loaded without complaint.
# Mobile Rules
MOBILE | Proxy the mobile app through an HTTP proxy and evaluate traffic for sensitive data being transmitted.
MOBILE | Evaluate the mobile device filesystem for sensitive data.
MOBILE | Map the infrastructure of the mobile application's backend.
MOBILE | Test the backend web infrastructure for XSS. 
MOBILE | Test the backend web infrastructure for SQLi. 
MOBILE | Test the backend web infrastructure for R/LFI.
MOBILE | Test the backend web APIs for common API flaws.
MOBILE | Ensure that restrictions on data retrieval functions are server-side and not client-side.
# Cloud Functionality
CLOUD | Check to see whether the manufacturer advertises any Internet or Cloud functionality, e.g., the ability to monitor the system remotely while traveling.
CLOUD | Determine how such functionality is executed, e.g., passing a port into the network, dialing out and meeting online, etc.
CLOUD | Determine what type of functionality is allowed through the remote interface.
CLOUD | Determine what type of encryption is enabled on the remote traffic.
CLOUD | Evaluate the authentication system used to authenticate to the Cloud interface.
CLOUD | Determine what default credentials exist in the system and/or what credentials are widely available online.
# JTAG Interface
JTAG | Determine whether the device has a JTAG interface.
JTAG | Connect to the JTAG interface and attempt to extract the system's firmware.
# Local Update System
LUS | Determine whether authentication was required to perform the update.
LUS | Determine whether it's possible to redirect the software writing location.
LUS | Determine the permissions that the update process runs as.
# Web Interface
WEB | Map the device's web interface in order to determine all pathing.
WEB | Determine the authentication mechanism for gaining access to the web interface.
WEB | Determine what functions can be performed once authenticated to the web interface.
WEB | Test the encryption of the web interface traffic.
WEB | Evaluate the certificate security of the device with a 10-year lifespan consideration.
